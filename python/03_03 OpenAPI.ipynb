The sandwich-making guy was great and gave us a sample of other meats. Overall a good experience at a famous place; however, we've had much better pastrami at a lot of other places. We've been there and no real reason to go back.\"\n",

      "   - Review: \"The sandwich portion is for two but is OVERPRICED. For one pastrami sandwich, one side of French fries, and two bottles of water ($52 USD). The taste of the pastrami is nothing out of this world. This cafeteria is ONLY name. The payment system is obsolete. They give you one ticket per person, and at the end you have to hand it in. If you lose it, you have to pay $50 USD. The place looks old and dirty. Dirty restroom. Definitively, we won’t EVER come back. Don't lose your money; go to another bakery, Denny's or other place.\"\n",
