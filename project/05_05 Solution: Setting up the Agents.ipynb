      "- **Breakfast at a Café:** Start your day with a classic Parisian breakfast at a local café. Enjoy fresh croissants, baguettes, and a café au lait.\n",
      "\n",
      "**10:00 AM - 12:00 PM:**\n",
      "- **Visit the Eiffel Tower:** Since it's currently partly cloudy, the morning is the best time to visit the Eiffel Tower. You can enjoy the view from both the ground and the top, but be prepared for some potential crowding.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Midday\n",
      "**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM:**\n",
      "- **Lunch at Le Jules Verne:** Dine at the renowned restaurant located on the Eiffel Tower. Enjoy a superb meal while taking in the view of Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Early Afternoon\n",
      "**1:00 PM - 3:00 PM:**\n",
      "- **Louvre Museum:** Head to the Louvre Museum to explore its vast collection of art, including the Mona Lisa. This indoor activity will shield you from any potential rain as the weather starts to turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Late Afternoon\n",
      "**3:00 PM - 5:00 PM:**\n",
      "- **Indoor Activities:** As heavy downpours and afternoon thundershowers are predicted, consider visiting other indoor attractions like the Musée d'Orsay or the La Sainte-Chapelle. Both provide beautiful interiors and engaging exhibitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evening\n",
      "**5:00 PM - 7:00 PM:**\n",
      "- **Shopping at Galeries Lafayette:** Spend some time shopping at this iconic department store. Its impressive glass dome and indoor shops will keep you dry while you browse.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7:00 PM - 9:00 PM:**\n",
      "- **Dinner at Le Train Bleu:** Enjoy dinner at this stunningly elegant restaurant located in Gare de Lyon. The Belle Époque interior will make for a truly memorable experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Night\n",
      "**9:00 PM - Onwards:**\n",
      "- **Evening Cruise on the Seine (Optional):** If the rain subsides, an evening cruise on the Seine River provides magical views of Paris's illuminated landmarks. Be sure to check weather updates before planning this.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Alternative Plan:**\n",
      "- **Café or Bar Visit:** Instead of the cruise, you can relax at a cozy café or bar. Paris has numerous charming spots where you can enjoy a glass of wine or a hot beverage while waiting for the night to unfold.\n",
