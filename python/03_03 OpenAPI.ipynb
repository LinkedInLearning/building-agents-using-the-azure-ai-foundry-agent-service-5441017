The taste of the pastrami is nothing out of this world. This cafeteria is ONLY name. The payment system is obsolete. They give you one ticket per person, and at the end you have to hand it in. If you lose it, you have to pay $50 USD. The place looks old and dirty. Dirty restroom. Definitively we won’t EVER come back. Don't lose your money go to another bakery, Dennis, or other places.\"\n",
